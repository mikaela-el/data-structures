My deardiary project will create a multi medium catalogue of all the things on the internet that I find interesting and relevant to myself each day. This idea was inspired by the many bookmark folders I keep on my browser and folders on my desktop that categorize things I find inspiring or interesting on the internet.  I want to use this project to create a database that I can look back on and see what peaked my interest on that specific day. By combining various mediums including text, photo, video and music,  I hope to be able to re-create the feelings I had on that specific day and  be able to accurately communicate them to someone else who is looking at my project in the future. This will ultimately create a visual and textual diary that can be used to not only communicate and track emotion but to compare feelings and moods based on a specific day in time.
